# Vuex ToDo

Yet another todo list exploration :P.

![demo](readmeAttachments/vuex-todo-demo.gif)

I created this one specifically to explore [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) to create a store with a shared state for the app. This demo is a bit more strip down and quick compared to the other vue explorations I've done lately because I wanted to get the general concept down. The full implementation isn't too too much different than my main [Vue.js ToDo list demo](https://github.com/chris-schmitz/VueToDos).
